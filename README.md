  -v $(pwd)/db:/db \
  --name xtream-to-strm \
  mourabena2ui/xtream-to-strm-web:latest

      - ./db:/db
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then start with:
```bash

### 3. Synchronize

Click **Sync Movies** or **Sync Series** to generate your files!

### 4. Download Content (Optional)

**Browse and Download:**
- Navigate to **Downloads** → **Media Selection**
- Browse available movies and series
- Add items to download queue
- Monitor downloads in **Download Manager**

**Auto-Monitoring:**
- Go to **Downloads** → **Monitoring**
- Add series or categories to watch
- New episodes download automatically

### 5. Live TV M3U (Optional)

**Generate Your Playlist:**
- Navigate to **Live TV** → **Live Selection**
- Select your subscription
- Click refresh to load bouquets
- Choose categories to include
- Copy or download your M3U URL
- Add URL to your IPTV player

### 6. Plex.tv Integration (Optional)

**Connect Your Plex Account:**
- Navigate to **Plex** → **Accounts**
- Enter your Plex.tv username and password
- Click **Add Account** to authenticate

**Configure Server:**
- Go to **Plex** → **Servers**
- Select your account to view available servers (including shared servers)
- Configure output directories for movies and series

**Sync Libraries:**
- Go to **Plex** → **Selection**
- Click **Sync Libraries** to fetch available libraries from your server
- Select the Movie and Show libraries you want to sync
- Click **Sync Movies** or **Sync Series** to generate STRM/NFO files

**Configure Proxy (Recommended):**
- Go to **Administration** → **Plex Settings**
- Set **Proxy Base URL** to an IP/hostname accessible by Jellyfin (not localhost)
- Optionally set a **Shared Key** to protect the proxy endpoint
- Enable **HLS Proxy Mode** if using clients like Findroid that don't follow HTTP redirects

> **Note:** Plex integration uses a proxy endpoint to hide authentication tokens from STRM files. This is essential for shared servers where direct file access is blocked.

> **HLS Proxy Mode:** Some clients (like Findroid, based on ExoPlayer) don't properly follow HTTP 302 redirects for HLS streams. When enabled, this mode proxies the HLS playlists (.m3u8) through your server while video segments (.ts) still stream directly from Plex, minimizing bandwidth impact on your server.

### 7. Configure Your Media Server

Point Jellyfin to the `/output` directory to scan your new content. The generated files follow Jellyfin's naming conventions for optimal recognition.

## 🎛️ NFO Configuration

Customize how titles are formatted in NFO files:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Prefix Regex** | Strip language/country prefixes | `FR - Movie` → `Movie` |
| **Format Date** | Move year to parentheses | `Name_2024` → `Name (2024)` |
| **Clean Name** | Replace underscores with spaces | `My_Movie` → `My Movie` |

Access these settings in **Administration** → **NFO Settings**
